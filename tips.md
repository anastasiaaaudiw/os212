### 1️⃣   Make sure you don't miss any forum in scele
Answering forum questions will force you to review about the week's materials and participate in OS course

### 2️⃣   Always study before the quiz
Since the time is very short, its best to prepare yourself before doing the tests by studying from the powerpoints or previous midterm questions and demos provided in the OS website

### 3️⃣   Don't miss any assignments deadline
Usually during every midweek there's contact forum in the scele website where you'll have to type ZCZC W0x github_account. There will be penalty scores for those who replied the forum late.

### 4️⃣   Follow the assignments' steps thoroughly
The powerpoint always gives to-do lists for each week's assignments and I think that the information provided are always complete, so make sure that you follow each steps so you won't get any minus points
