# Links üîó
## Links that I consider helpful for the Operating System course ‚å®Ô∏è
### [üñá  REPO](https://github.com/anastasiaaaudiw/os212) | [üñä  LOG](TXT/mylog.txt) | [üõã HOME](index.md)

### [üî∫ Scele - Fasilkom UI](https://scele.cs.ui.ac.id/)
This website is essential to every Fasilkom UI student. Because almost all course resources are provided on this website, thus I find it very convenient for the OS course since it'll be easy for me to commute to the website.

### [üî∫ Operating System Course Site - Fasilkom UI](https://os.vlsm.org/)
This site is build by the OS lecturer as a facilitator site for the students. I find this link helpful because I can access the materials and information easily by clicking this site, it also contains links to lecture materials, exam questions, as well as assignments. 

### [‚û°Ô∏è Begineer's introduction of Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-operating-system-set-1/)
This website gave a brief definition of the operating system, its functions, its significant functionalities, and its types.This website is helpful for me because I can understand the basic knowledge about Operating systems beforehand. 

### [‚û°Ô∏è Introduction to Linux Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-linux.html) or [Operating System - Linux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_linux.htm)
Linux is an operating system or a kernel that distributed under an open-source license. The kernel is a program of Linux that takes care of fundamental stuff such as letting hardware communicate with software. I believe these two links would be helpful for me to understand Linux better. 

### [‚û°Ô∏è Linux from scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/)
This website provides lots of knowledge about Linux, especially for those who want to learn more wholly. 

### [‚û°Ô∏è Introduction to Cyber Security for begineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inWWhr5tnEA)
Cyber Security refers to the method of protecting programs, networks, computer systems, and their components from unauthorized digital access and attacks. I find this video helpful because it gives a simple explanation of cyber security along with its components, examples, and how it works. Thus, I was able to understand better about cyber security thanks to this video. 

### [‚û°Ô∏è C Language Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.in/c-tutorial/) or [Learn the basics of C language](https://www.learn-c.org/)
These two websites provide the tutorial on how to understand C language from basics to intermediate. I find it very convenient since I do not know anything about the C language. Thus I think I'll be reading them over these resources to comprehend the rest of the OS class.
