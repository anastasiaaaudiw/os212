### [Operating System Course Site - Fasilkom UI](https://os.vlsm.org/)
This site is build by the OS lecturer as a facilitator site for the students. I find this link helpful because I can access the materials and information easily by clicking this site, it also contains links to lecture materials, exam questions, as well as assignments. 

### [Begineer's introduction of Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-operating-system-set-1/)
This website gave a brief definition of the operating system, its functions, its significant functionalities, and its types.This website is helpful for me because I can understand the basic knowledge about Operating systems beforehand. 

### [Introduction to Linux Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-linux.html) or [Operating System - Linux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_linux.htm)
Linux is an operating system or a kernel that distributed under an open-source license. The kernel is a program of Linux that takes care of fundamental stuff such as letting hardware communicate with software. I believe these two links would be helpful for me to understand Linux better.
